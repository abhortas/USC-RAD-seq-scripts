######################### DESCRIPTION #########################

>SharedExclusiveSNPs.pl 

This script was designed to obtain shared and exclusive SNPs from STACKS 2 and Meyer's 2b-RAD v2.1 pipeline. The definition what is considered shared and exclusive SNP is explained here:
Only would be considered shared SNPs those from CD-HIT clusters composed by only one RAD-loci per pipeline. Uniquely SNPs which RAD loci cluster together, and share position will be considered as shared SNPs. It would be considered exclusive SNPs those from CH-HIT clusters composed by RAD-loci belonging to the same building-loci pipeline.
This script use the .clstr output from CD-HIT. Furthermore, it uses two more input files consistent in SNPs index from each pipeline (i.e. -s and -m options). For comparisons between different bulding-loci pipelines, minor modifications are necessary.
You would have to check if both pipelines under comparison have the same counting system (i.e. if the first position is 0 or 1).

Command example: perl SharedExclusiveSNPs.pl -s stacks_SNP_index.txt -m meyer_SNP_index.txt -c RADloci_clusters.clstr -o ./ -l 36

>GenotypicDifferencesMeter.pl

This script was designed to count the different type of mismatches between two genepop files from different building-loci pipelines with shared SNPs. Three input files have to be provided:

    1. A shared SNP index (output from SharedExclusiveSNPs.pl script).
    2. Genepop from building-loci pipeline 1.
    3. Genepop from building-loci pipeline 2.
    
The genepop format is the same as the STACKS output, after populations module.

Command example: perl GenotypicDifferencesMeter.pl -s shared_SNPs.txt -g1 shared_genepop_stacks.gen -g2 shared_genepop_meyer.gen -o ./results.txt
